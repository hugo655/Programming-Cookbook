# **C/C++**

Given these two languages are quite similar, I decided to group them together.

## **File Purpose**

`main_argv.cpp` - Basic code for interacting with command line arguments

`multi_file_project` - A sample project that includes a typical Makefile, Header file (including
`#ifndef` and `extern "C"` boilerplates 

## **Ideas for projects**
`input_file` - Basic program that receives as input a file and outputs some processed text in 
an output file

`input_options` - Basic program that treats and handles command flags as `-h` `-o`
