# **Programming Cookbook**

## **About this repository**
This repo is a collection of some code snippets I wish I had in hands whenever I am
coding in these languages. Like most people, I feel like I always go to the same 
webpages for a quick look on some common basic structures.

Most, of not all, of the pieces of code saved in here are from someone else I copied,
studied and added own notes and comments on whatever I thought It was relevant to me
at the time. Think of these pieces of code as my personal public notebook.

## **Repository Structure**

The repo is organized in such way that each directory represents a language/group of
languages. It is my intent to keep them as much organized as possible, but can't give
any guarantees.
